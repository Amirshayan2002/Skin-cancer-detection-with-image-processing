# **Skin Cancer Detection Using Image Processing**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on detecting skin cancer using image processing and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify skin lesions based on image features and improve early diagnosis accuracy. The project leverages various machine learning models such as **CNN, SVM, and KNN** to analyze and classify skin abnormalities.  

## **Features**  
- **Image Preprocessing:** Noise reduction, contrast enhancement, and segmentation  
- **Feature Extraction:** Color, texture, and shape analysis  
- **Machine Learning Models:** CNN, SVM, KNN for classification  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score analysis  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Dataset:** Publicly available skin lesion datasets (e.g., ISIC Dataset)  

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Skin-Cancer-Detection.git
   cd Skin-Cancer-Detection
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the main script:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```  

## **Usage**  
1. Upload a skin lesion image.  
2. The system preprocesses the image and extracts relevant features.  
3. A trained machine learning model classifies the lesion as benign or malignant.  
4. The result is displayed along with confidence scores.  

## **Results**  
The model achieves **X% accuracy** on the test dataset. Below is an example of classification results:  
| Image | Prediction | Confidence |  
|--------|------------|------------|  
| ![Sample Image](path/to/image.png) | Malignant | 92% |  

## **Future Improvements**  
- Enhance model accuracy with more training data  
- Implement deep learning approaches for improved classification  
- Deploy as a web or mobile application for real-time predictions
